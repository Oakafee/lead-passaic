The New York Times called the recent lead crisis in Newark, NJ’s drinking water supply “one of the worst environmental disasters to strike a U.S. city in decades” (Armstrong 2021). It has been resolved but at great expense after years of health risk.

Lead contamination in drinking water:
- Lead service lines connecting homes/buildings to water mains
- Old construction
- Water treatment plants can prevent contamination with corrosion control, etc.

Urban decline, do you know the history? Cash-strapped cities struggle with water treatment.

Is this just a Newark problem, or is it more widespread?

Look at the cities and suburbs of Northeastern NJ
Five urban and suburban counties: Essex, Hudson, Bergen, Passaic and Morris...roughly, the Passaic River watershed

Data available from the NJDEP from 2002 to present.

EPA sets 0.015 mg/L as the maximum contaminant level (MCL). Number of years during which a MCL violation occurred (2002-2021)

Maximum recorded lead level 2002-2021

Average lead concentration 2002-2021

Newark didn't have the highest level of lead, the longest-lasting problem, or the greatest exposure over the whole time period, but ranks fairly highly for all three.




It is among the region's most serious lead problems because of its high population.

However, lead contamination problems in Northeastern NJ is both urban and suburban.
